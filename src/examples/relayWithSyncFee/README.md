# RelayWithSyncFee

## Smart Contracts

There are multiple examples here, varying in complexity. Let's start with the simplest.

### Counter.sol

We have deployed a simple counter contract to many networks, see [here](https://blockscan.com/address/0xEEeBe2F778AA186e88dCf2FEb8f8231565769C27) for a reference list.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import { GelatoRelayContext } from "@gelatonetwork/relay-context/contracts/GelatoRelayContext.sol";

contract Counter is GelatoRelayContext {
  uint256 public counter;

  event IncrementCounter();

  function increment() external onlyGelatoRelay {
    // payment to Gelato
    _transferRelayFee();

    counter += 1;
    emit IncrementCounter();
  }
}

```

This simple counter contract inherits `GelatoRelayContext` to benefit from the `_transferRelayFee` function. This function provides a succinct way to add payment logic which facilitates payment directly to Gelato during the call forward. This payment method is only applicable when using the `relayWithSyncFee` SDK method. For more information on `GelatoRelayContext`, please see [here](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-products/gelato-relay-sdk/prerequisites#gelatos-relay-context).

This counter contract has one target function `increment`. A useful way of checking on our relay call is looking out for the `IncrementCounter` event on-chain after we submit our relay request.

### CounterERC2771.sol

To demonstrate how to make your contract ERC-2771 compatible using OpenZeppelin's [ERC2771Context](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/metatx), we have modified our counter contract and deployed it on many [networks](https://blockscan.com/address/0x30d97B13e29B0cd42e6ebd48dbD9063465bF1997) for your testing.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import { ERC2771Context } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/metatx/ERC2771Context.sol";

// Inheriting ERC2771Context gives access to:
// 1. isTrustedForwarder(), returns true if the address is the trustedForwarder
// 2. _msgSender() - function to retrieve original off-chain sender by
// taking last 20 bytes of calldata.
contract CounterERC2771 is ERC2771Context {
  // A mapping of a counter to each _msgSender()
  mapping(address => uint256) public contextCounter;

  event IncrementContextCounter(address _msgSender);

  // a modifier which utilises `isTrustedForwarder` for security.
  modifier onlyTrustedForwarder() {
    require(
      isTrustedForwarder(msg.sender),
      "Only callable by Trusted Forwarder"
    );
    _;
  }

  // Setting the trustedForwarder upon contract deployment
  //solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
  constructor(address trustedForwarder) ERC2771Context(trustedForwarder) {}

  // `incrementContext` is the target function to call
  // this function increments the counter mapped to the _msgSender
  function incrementContext() external onlyTrustedForwarder {
    address _msgSender = _msgSender();

    contextCounter[_msgSender]++;

    // Emitting an event for testing purposes
    emit IncrementContextCounter(_msgSender);
  }
}

```

`CounterERC2771.sol` is an [ERC-2771](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-products/gelato-relay-sdk/prerequisites#erc-2771) compatible counter contract. What does this compatibility mean in practice?

In practice, ERC-2771 allows `target` smart contracts to permission the calling of a function based on the trusted forwarder and the orignator of the request off-chain (whose identity is verified using signature validation by the Gelato Relay smart contract).

1. ERC-2771 `_msgSender` retrieval from the calldata. `_msgSender` is the address of the originator of the relay request. This is data from off-chain which Gelato Relay encodes onto the end of the calldata when executing the message on chain.
2. ERC-2771 `trustedForwarder` which, in this case, is the address of Gelato Relay (`0xaBcC9b596420A9E9172FD5938620E265a0f9Df92`), which is used as a modifier for a target function. This means only the trusted forwarder can call the required function.

The `target` function `incrementContext` is very similar to `Counter.sol` but it will only increment the counter for each `_msgSender`.

### MyDummyWallet.sol

`MyDummyWallet.sol` is a simple smart contract wallet. It is used to illustrate more real-world use cases of Gelato Relay, now that you have got the hang of things with `Counter.sol` and `CounterERC2771.sol`.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.17;

import { GelatoRelayContext } from "@gelatonetwork/relay-context/contracts/GelatoRelayContext.sol";

import { Address } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";
import { IERC20, SafeERC20 } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
import { NATIVE_TOKEN } from "./constants/Tokens.sol";

// Importing GelatoRelayContext gives access to:
// 1. onlyGelatoRelayModifier
// 2. payment methods, i.e. _transferRelayFee
// 3. _getFeeCollector(), _getFeeToken(), _getFee()
contract MyDummyWallet is GelatoRelayContext {
  using Address for address payable;
  using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

  // emitting an event for testing purposes
  event LogSendToFriend(address indexed to, uint256 amount);
  event LogBalance(uint256 indexed balance);

  // this function uses this contract's ERC-20 token balance to send
  // an _amount of tokens to the _to address
  function sendToFriend(
    address _token,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount
  ) external onlyGelatoRelay {
    // Payment to Gelato
    // NOTE: be very careful here!
    // if you do not use the onlyGelatoRelay modifier,
    // anyone could encode themselves as the fee collector
    // in the low-level data and drain tokens from this contract.
    _transferRelayFee();

    // transfer of tokens
    if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) payable(_to).sendValue(_amount);
    else IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);

    emit LogSendToFriend(_to, _amount);
  }

  // this functions emits the current balance of the wallet contract
  // in an event that we can check on-chain.
  function emitBalance() external onlyGelatoRelay {
    // Payment to Gelato
    // NOTE: be very careful here!
    // if you do not use the onlyGelatoRelay modifier,
    // anyone could encode themselves as the fee collector
    // in the low-level data and drain tokens from this contract.
    _transferRelayFee();

    emit LogBalance(address(this).balance);
  }
}

```

The first line imports `GelatoRelayContext` from our [relay-context](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gelatonetwork/relay-context) package. To read in detail about this, please visit the [docs](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-products/gelato-relay/quick-start/relaywithsyncfee/relay-context-contracts). In brief, inheriting the `GelatoRelayContext` contract gives you access to information that Gelato appends to the end of your target payload, so that you can access important variables from within your target function during the relay call. These variables are:

- address `feeCollector`: the address of Gelato's fee collector contract to which the relay fee should be paid to
- address `feeToken`: the address of the token you have requested to pay in
- uint256 `fee`: the fee amount to be paid to the `feeCollector` address.

In case, you already possess the fee beforehand by querying our [fee oracle](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-products/gelato-relay/quick-start/gelatos-fee-oracle), you can inherit `GelatoRelayFeeCollector` (see the relevant page on the docs [here](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-products/gelato-relay/quick-start/relaywithsyncfee/relay-context-contracts#gelatorelayfeecollector)) instead.

## Building and Sending a Relay Request

### increment.ts

Located at `src/examples/relayWithSyncFee/increment.ts`, you will find a script which allows you to call the `increment` function on the counter contract.

To run this script, make sure you have [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) installed, and run the following command in your terminal:

```
ts-node src/examples/relayWithSyncFee/increment.ts
```

### emitBalance.ts

Located at `src/examples/relayWithSyncFee/emitBalance.ts`, you will find a script which allows you to call the `emitBalance` function on the myDummyWallet contract.

To run this script, make sure you have [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) installed, and run the following command in your terminal:

```
ts-node src/examples/relayWithSyncFee/emitBalance.ts
```

### sendToFriend.ts

Located at `src/examples/relayWithSyncFee/sendToFriend.ts`, you will find a script which allows you to call the `sendToFriend` function on the counter contract.

```
ts-node src/examples/relayWithSyncFee/sendToFriend.ts
```

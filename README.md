# Relay Docs Examples

- This repo contains the contracts used for code examples in the [Relay SDK docs](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-products/gelato-relay-sdk).
- This repo is intended as something you can clone and get started with local testing straight away, but bear in mind, this is a WIP.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo:

- `git clone https://github.com/gelatodigital/relay-docs-examples`

Install the packages locally and configure everything with:

- `yarn build`

You are ready to move on to the code examples which interest you most! They are categorised by the [relay SDK methods](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-products/gelato-relay-sdk/sdk-methods).

# Relay Docs Examples

- This repo contains the contracts used for code examples in the [Relay SDK docs](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-products/gelato-relay-sdk).
- This repo is intended as something you can clone and get started with local testing straight away, but bear in mind, this is a WIP.
- Furthermore, the ultimate aim is to have all code examples from the docs, working, with tests, so that you, as a developer, can get started immediately with just one `git clone` command.
